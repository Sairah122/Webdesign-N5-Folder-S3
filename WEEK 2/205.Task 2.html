The Zoo is a delightful oasis designed specifically for young explorers.

in the petting zoo to the playful otters swimming in their habitat,
the Zoo encourages hands-on learning and sparks curiosity about the
natural world.

Interactive exhibits and engaging signage teach children about animal
care, habitats, and conservation efforts. With safe, kid-sized walkways
and plenty of shaded areas, the Zoo provides a safe, welcoming environment
for families to discover the wonders of the animal kingdom.
